## Terminal Operations Challenge Part 1

In this challenge, you'll use the terminal operations shown on this slide.
You'll be using these, to answer some questions about a series of students.
It contains a Student class with demographic data.

This class has a factory method, to generate a new instance of a Student, using random data.
This factory method will also generate some random activity, for each course passed as an argument, to the Student constructor.

Create a source for a stream of Students.
Use the static method on Student as the Supplier.
Use a large enough number to get a variety of Student data.
Use a combination of the intermediate and terminal operations we've covered so far, to answer the following questions.
 - How many male and female students are in the group?
 - How many students fall into the three age ranges, less than age 30, between 30 and 60, over 60 years old.
 - Use summaryStatistics on student's age, to get a better idea of how old the student population is.
 - What countries are the students from? Print a distinct list of the country codes.
 - Are there students that are still active, that have been enrolled for more than 7 years? Use one of the match terminal operations to answer this question.
 - Next, select 5 of the students above, and print their information out.
