## Terminal Operations Challenge Part 2

Create a new class called MainChallenge, with a main method that does the following:
 - Copy the two courses, jmc and pymc, from the MainCollect's main method, passing both an additional argument for the lecture count, so 50 for pymc, and 100 for jmc.
 - Add a third course, titled "Creating Games in Java". You don't have to pass a lecture count for this one.
 - Use Stream.generate or Stream.iterate to generate 5000 random students, and create a list of these.
 - Use your getPercentComplete method, to calculate the average percentage completed for all students for just the Java Masterclass, using the reduce terminal operation.
 - Use this result, multiplying it by 1.25, to collect a group of students (either as a list, or a set). These would be the students who've completed more than three quarters of that average percentage.
 - Sort by the longest enrolled students who are still active, because you're going to offer your new course to 10 of these students, for a trial run.
 - Add the new course to these ten students.
Make one change to the Student's getRandomStudent method, using a minimum lecture of 30.
