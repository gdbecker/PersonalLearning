## Method References Code Along and Challenge

Coded along with Tim for method references example, and also includes the below challenge:

### Method and Lambda Challenge

First, create an array of names, in mixed case, as you did in the Lambda Expression Challenge.
Create a list of Function interfaces, or alternately UnaryOperator, which will contain all the operations you want executed on each name in your array.
Do something similar to what we did in the Lambda Expression challenge:
 - Make each name upper case,
 - Add a random middle initial,
 - Add a last name, which should be the reverse of the first.
In addition to this, add some custom transformations of your own.

Use a mix of lambda expressions, and method references.
Create a method that takes the name array, and the function list, and applies each function to each name, using the transform method on String, to do this.
All changes should be applied to the original array.
Make sure you explore as many transformations as you can, trying as many different types of method references as you can think of.
