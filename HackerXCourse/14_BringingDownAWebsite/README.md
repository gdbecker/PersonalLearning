### Bringing down a website
- Whenever there is a big sale on some e-commerce site, at the moment of sale, you might have noticed that the site gets slow or stops working
- This happens because there are a lot of requests coming to the site, which is also its server at the same time
- This similar thing we can do as a hacker and deny the service of the application to its legitimate users

### Denial of Service attacks
- DoS is an attack used to deny legitimate users access to a resource such as accessing a website network, emails, etc or making it extremely slow
- DoS = Denial of Service
- This type of attack is usually implemented by hitting the target resource such as a web server with too many requests at the same time
- This results in the server failing to respond to all the requests. The effect of this can either be crashing the servers or slowing them down
- Two types:
  - DoS: performed by a single host
  - Distributed DoS: performed by a number of compromised machines that all target the same victim. It floods the network with data packets
