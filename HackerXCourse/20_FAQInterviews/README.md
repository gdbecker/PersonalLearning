### General hacking based
1. Can you explain what ethical hacking is?
   1. Ethical hacking is when the individual is allowed to hack the systems with permission of the merchandise owner to search out for weaknesses in an exceedingly system and later fix them
2. What are the hacking stages? Explain each stage
   1. Should consist of these 5 stages:
   2. Surveillance/recon: hacker endeavors to gather as much data as possible about the target
   3. Scanning: includes exploiting the data accumulated amid the surveillance stage and using it to inspect the causality. The hacker can use computerized devices amid the scanning phase which can incorporate port scanners, mappers, and vulnerability scanners
   4. Getting access: this is where the real hacking happens. The hacker attempts to exploit data found amid the surveillance and scanning stage to get access
   5. Access Maintenance: once access is granted, hackers need to keep that access for future exploitation and assaults by securing their exclusive access with backdoors, rootkits, and trojans
   6. Covering tracks: once hackers have possessed the capacity to pick up and maintain access, they cover their tracks and keep away from getting detected
3. What is active and passive reconnaissance?
   1. Passive is nothing but to gain info regarding targeted computers and networks, while not actively participating with the systems
   2. Active is when the attacker engages with the target system, usually conducting a port scan to find any open ports
4. Who is known as a black hat, white hat, or grey hat hackers?
   1. Black hat = one who performs hacking (penetration or exploitation) without authority and with malicious intent
   2. White hat = authorized penetration tester
   3. Grey hat = one who performs hacking (penetration or exploitation) without authority but without malicious intent. They perform the activity for bounty programs or security testing, without getting authorized to do so
5. What is the difference between hacking and ethical hacking?
   1. Hacking = illegal way of accessing the system
   2. Ethical hacking = legal way of accessing the system

### Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
1. What is the difference between VA and PT?
   1. Vulnerability Assessment (VA) = process to identify the weaknesses and loopholes in the system, server, or asset. Mostly it's an automated process that can be identified with different tools available in the market
   2. Penetration Testing (PT) = process to exploit the vulnerabilities which are identified in VA. It can be performed in both manual and automated ways. Manually we can perform, based on the info gathered of server details, versions framework, etc
2. What is the different between a MAC and an IP address?
   1. All networks across devices are assigned a number that is unique, which is terms as MAC or Media Access Control address. This address may be a personal mailbox on the internet. The network router identifies it. The amount may be modified anytime
   2. All devices get their distinctive information processing address so they can be located easily on a given laptop and network. Whoever is aware of your distinctive information processing address will contact you through it
3. What are the types of penetration testing?
   1. Black box = no previous knowledge of the network
   2. White box = knowledge of remote network
4. Can you name the top 10 vulnerabilities?
   1. Injection
   2. Broken authentication
   3. Sensitive data exposure
   4. XML External Entities (XXE)
   5. Broken Access Control
   6. Security misconfigurations
   7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   8. Insecure deserialization
   9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
   10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

### Network attacks
1. How can you avoid ARP poisoning?
   1. ARP poisoning is a type of network attack that can be resolved through these techniques:
   2. Using packet filtering: packet filters can filter out and block packets with clashing source address data
   3. Keeping away from te trust relationship: organizations ought to develop a protocol that depends on trust relationships as little as they can
   4. Utilize ARP spoofing software: some programs assess and certify info before it's transmitted and blocks any info that's spoofed
2. What is network sniffing?
   1. System sniffing includes using sniffer tools that empower real-time monitoring and analysis of data streaming over PC systems. Sniffers can be used for various purposes, regardless of whether it's to steal data or manage systems
   2. Network sniffing is used for ethical and unethical purposes. System admins use these as system monitoring and analysis tools, to analyze and avoid network-related issues such as traffic bottlenecks. Cybercriminals use these devices for untrustworthy purposes such as character usurpation, email, delicate information hijacking, etc
3. What is a firewall?
   1. Could be a device that allows/blocks traffic as per an outlined set of rules. These are placed o the boundary of trusted and untrusted networks
4. What is MAC flooding?
   1. MAC flooding is a kind of technique wherever the protection of a given network switch is compromised
   2. The hacker floods the switch with sizeable amounts of frames than what a switch can handle. This makes the switch behave as a hub and transmits all packets to all the existing ports
   3. Taking advantage of this, attackers can attempt to send packets within the network to steal sensitive information
5. What is meant by a spoofing attack and what are the different types?
   1. A spoofing attack is when a malicious party impersonates another device or user on a network, so as to launch attacks against network hosts, steal data, unfold malware, or bypass access controls. Different spoofing attacks are deployed by malicious parties to achieve this
   2. ARP spoofing attack
   3. DNS spoofing attack
   4. IP spoofing attack
