## Overview

### [Project Brief](./project%20brief/)

Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Mobile-first workflow
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### What I learned

After working through Brad Traversy's [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) this was great to keep practicing with vanilla HTML and CSS on this product preview card. Frameworks and utility classes are definitely helpful but I will say that I feel a lot more confident in my frontend skills by knowing the raw tools, especially with the CSS styles. I approached this one by getting the structure laid out as needed, using flex boxes and using flex-direction column or row, and then worked on each element's styling at a time. Once the desktop design was down then I adjusted to smaller mobile screens and tweaked the design from there. I definitely want to keep practicing using the basic tools in more projects like this one.

Here are a few code samples from this project:

```html
<!-- HTML Card Structure -->

```

```css
/* Styling for smaller screens */

```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as components like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Formatter](http://www.lonniebest.com/FormatCSS/) - I found this helpful site when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to format my CSS code, I can have this do it for me, especially putting everything in alphabetical order.
- Brad Traversy's [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) - I highly recommend this course for great practice in using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build amazing projects.
