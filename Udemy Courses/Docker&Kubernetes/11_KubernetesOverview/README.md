## 11_ Getting Started with Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?
- An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- De-facto standard for orchestrating deployment
- It's not a cloud service provider; it's an open-source project
- It's not a service offered by a cloud provider; but it can be used with any of them
- It's not a software, but a collection of concepts and tools
- Not an alternative to Docker, but works with containers produced with Docker
- Not a paid service, but free to use
- Kubernetes is like Docker-Compose but for multiple machines!

### Why Kubernetes?
- Won't lock you into one cloud provider or location where you want to deploy
- Use Kubernetes config files and same setup process for any provider where you're deploying
