## 01_ What is Cloud Computing?

### What is it?
- What is a server composed of?
  - Compute: CPU
  - Memory: RAM - store and retrive info fast
  - CPU + RAM = "brain"
  - Storage: Data
  - Database: store data in a structured way
  - Network: routers, switch, DNS server
- IT terms
  - Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
  - Router: a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
  - Switch: takes a packet and send it to the correct server/client on your network
- Problems with a traditional IT approach
  - Pay for rent for the data center?
  - Pay for power supply, cooling, and maintenance
  - Adding and replacing hardware takes time
  - Scaling is limited
  - Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
  - How to deal with natural disasters?
  - Can we externalize all this? Yes!
- What is cloud computing?
  - On-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, apps, and other IT resources
  - Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
  - You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
  - You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
  - Simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services
  - AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web app
- Deployment models of the cloud
  - Private cloud
    - Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
    - Complete control
    - Security for sensitive apps
    - Meet specific business needs
  - Public cloud
    - Resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
    - 6 advantages of Cloud Computing
  - Hybrid cloud
    - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
    - Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
    - Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
- 5  characteristics of cloud computing
  - On-demand self service
    - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
  - Broad network access
    - Resources available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
  - Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
    - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and apps with security and privacy
    - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
  - Rapid elasticity and scalability
    - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
    - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
  - Measured service
    - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they've used
- 6 advantages of cloud computing
  - Trade capital expenses (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
    - Pay on-demand: don't own hardware
    - Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational expense (OPEX)
  - Benefit from massive economies of scale
    - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
  - Stop guessing capacity
    - Scale based on actual measured usage
  - Increase speed and agility
  - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
  - Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure
- Problems solved by the cloud
  - Flexibility: change resource types when needed
  - Cost-effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
  - Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
  - Elasticity: ability to scale-out and scale-in when needed
  - High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
  - Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software apps

### Different types of cloud computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - Highest level of flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
  - Examples: EC2
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - Examples: Elastic Beanstalk
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your apps
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Completed product that's run and managed by the service provider
  - Examples: Rekognition
- Pricing of the cloud
  - AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals: following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
  - Compute: pay for compute time
  - Storage: pay for the data stored on the cloud
  - Data transfer OUT of the cloud; data transfer IN is free
  - Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

### AWS cloud overview
- History
  - Launched internally in 2002
  - First offering in 2003: SQS
  - 2007: launched in Europe
- AWS is the cloud leader
- Use cases
  - Build sophisticated and scalable apps
  - Applicable to many industries
  - Use cases can include
    - Enterprise IT, backup and storage, Big Data analytics
    - Website hosting, mobile and social apps
    - Gaming
- Global infrastructure 
  - AWS Regions
    - Has regions all around the world, and each has a different name
    - It's a cluster of data centers
    - Most AWS services are region-scoped
    - How do you choose a region?
      - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permissions
      - Proximity to customers: reduced latency
      - Available services with a region: new services and new features aren't available in every region
      - Pricing: varies from region to region, and is transparent in the service pricing page
  - AWS Availability Zones
    - Each region has many, minimum is 3, max is 6
    - Usually each region has 3
    - Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity 
    - They're separate from each other; so that they're isolated from disasters
    - They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
  - AWS Data Centers
  - AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presences
    - Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
    - Content is delivered to end users with low latency
- AWS Console
  - AWS has Global Services
    - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    - Route 53 (DNS service)
    - CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
    - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
  - Most AWS services are region-scoped
    - EC2 (IaaS)
    - Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS)
    - Lambda (Function as a Service)
    - Rekognition (SaaS)

### Shared Responsibility Model and AWS Acceptable Policy
- Customer = responsible for the security IN the cloud
- AWS = responsible for the security OF the cloud
- Acceptable Policy: don't do bad things like network abuse, security violations, etc
