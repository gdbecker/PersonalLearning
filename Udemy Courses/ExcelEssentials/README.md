What other students are saying:
- "This is the most comprehensive course I've seen on Udemy..." - Renato Ferreira
- "This course is a must and it could be the only one you need, if you want to master Excel for any reason. It is well organized, it covers all topics of Excel, from the fundamentals (formatting, writing data, put that data to use, etc...), continuing to a more advance use of the program, like applications for the formulas included in the app. But the part that outstands in the course, is the macro-programming part. It helps you to start programming in VBA in a step by step fashion. The instructor explains every lesson quite well, he is easy to follow, and you can notice he knows the app and have lots of experience with it. He is also very responsive and will reach you as soon as he can in case you have any doubt about the topics covered in the course. For me is a five stars course, thumbs up for a well roundup course." - David Garcia Silvarrey
- "This is the best Excel course ever! I like that the topics are broken down into few minutes at a time". - Sheryl Blosel
- "This course is wonderful. If you were and absolute beginner like I was, this is the course that you should take. This course starts at the absolute beginning and shows you in detail how to use the program and how to make it do what you need it to. I am almost through section 2 and I cant believe how much I have learned and I couldn't imagine taking an Excel course from anyone else. If you are thinking about getting an Excel course for refreshing your skills, or just starting from the beginning, this is the course for you" - Jake Rose

Getting to grips with Excel will give you a distinct advantage in whatever work you currently do, and can open the door to new opportunities.

Many of my students have gone on to get better paying jobs, change career, or even start their own businesses, using the very skills you will soon master.

“I spent over 30 years mastering Excel, so you don't have to!”

In this course we cover in detail all of the basic functions of Excel, and you will learn not only how to use it, but some powerful tools to allow you understand how it works. There is a difference between repeating something and understanding it.

Who is this course aimed at?
- Complete beginners, and those who want to build a solid foundation upon which to build their skills.

How is it structured?
- Together we concentrate on building a single complete project from beginning to end, using all the basic functions and give you a thorough understanding.
- I know your time is valuable, so most lectures are between 3-5 minutes, allowing you to dip in and out when it's convenient for you. This also maximizes your learning, and makes it easy if you ever need to go back to refresh your memory...no need to click through a 40 minute lecture to find the part you're looking for!
- There are screencasts, lots of quizzes, presentations, pdfs, downloadable files...all designed to optimize your learning.

What do I get with this course?
- Lifetime access to over 4 hours of HD content.
- Over 50 bite-size lectures, each covering a specific topic in detail. Some of which I have never seen taught before!
- Multiple quizzes to ensure you cement your learning!
- Downloadable source file, practice file, and pdf cheat sheets that you can take with you and quickly refer back to if you are away from home.
- Access to the Q&A forum, so if you have any questions, you can ask me!

What other students are saying:
- "This course is exactly what I was looking for. Simply explained, and in a level of detail I could follow. I really enjoyed it, and will recommend it to all my friend"s – Beatrice
- "This course [Level 1] gives a solid foundation for a beginner who wants to develop their skills...To sum up Folks, this is a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED course. I will be shortly enrolling myself in the next course with Alan of course" – Alex
- "Fantastic course! The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and the way he organized the course makes it extremely easy to follow. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to increase their knowledge of Excel." – Dan Hughes

So, Why take THIS course?
- I have been using Excel for over 20 years, but there is a difference between being good at something and being able to teach it. In that time I have taught thousands of people how to master its power. Because I have taught so many people, I know not to assume you already understand something, and I have probably already heard every question you are likely to have.
- This course took over 4 months to produce, and has been tested extensively with hundreds of people. If something didn't work, or wasn't clear, it was revised until it did, to make this the best possible course on Excel.
- Of course, we never stop learning, and I will continue to develop this course, and your skills, with your feedback. And remember, if you have a question, post it in the Q&A and I will answer it for you personally.

In Excel Essentials: Level 3 - VBA Programming:
- If you really want to harness the full power of Excel, then learning how to program in VBA is ESSENTIAL!
- If you got this far, it's because:
  - You want to join the Excel elite, and program your own solutions?
  - Maybe you want to automate most of your work, do more in less time with less effort?
  - Could be you want to earn more money?
  - Perhaps you may even fancy a career change?

If you answered yes to any of the above, I want you in my student community!

In this course you will learn everything you need to know about coding in VBA, even if you've never looked at a line of code before!

What other students are saying:
- "This is a great course! ...I can't wait to start using it. I will certainly be using the emailing program! And reports. My mind is reeling!" - Nickie Student!
- "Taught in easy bite size chunks makes the learning fun as well as informative" – Joe Long
- "If you are serious about learning how to make excel work for you, you should take this course" - Beatrice

Introducing Visual Basic For Applications
- Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, is included with Excel, so there's nothing more to buy. If you have Excel, you already have access to VBA.
- VBA is the powerhouse. It's the code that lives under the hood where the magic happens.
- A lot of people can record a Macro, but being able to program in VBA is quite a different thing. It separates the good from the truly amazing, and I want you to be amazing!
- Now, one of those words in "Visual Basic for Applications" carries more weight than the others. And no, it's not "Basic" (though coding the way I will teach you is simple!).
- No, it's "Applications". In fact, it's the "s" at the very end. The significance is that VBA works across ALL MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS! Word, Outlook, Access, PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, and even WINDOWS ITSELF!

In this course I will not only teach you how to code for Excel, there are even THREE, no...FOUR Bonus Sections:
- Controlling Word
- Controlling Outlook
- Yes, even controlling Windows
- and now...Automating PowerPoint!

What Makes Me Qualified To Teach You?
- Well, I'm a regular guy. I don't have a University degree, but what I do have is the drive to learn new things and never be beaten by a problem...a lot like you, I guess.
- What I also have is over 20 years of experience in using Excel, and programming solutions with VBA.
- I have built simple helper systems to make life easier for my colleagues. I've programmed complete MRP systems to run the procurement division of a £1.3b company, and everything in between.

So, I can do it, does that mean I can teach you?

You bet! I have taught hundreds of students one on one, and even more in groups. Many of my students have gone on to better paying jobs, start their own businesses, or at the very least made their work lives less stressful! One of my most recent students got a promotion and a 15% pay rise just 16 weeks after learning how to code! Not bad, hey?


Why Is Your Course Different, Alan?

I'm glad you asked!

If you got this far, you already know you get:
- Over 15 hours of HD video lectures
- 72 downloadable resources
- Quizzes
- All the source code for the course + more!
- Programming projects

There are lots of great courses on coding in VBA. There are even lots of free videos on YouTube. Many of them show you all the basics in kind of a "little bit of everything" approach. I looked at what was available, and I knew I had to create something different. Of course, I still cover all the basics, just like the other courses, but we will go beyond the basics, and cover in depth the "missing bits".

In addition, I will teach you my step-by-step process, the actual methods I use to build powerful solutions easily and quickly. I'm sure programming can be difficult, but not the way I do it!

You will learn how streamline your code for efficiency (and make it execute faster!) from the beginning. After we've covered all the basics, we will go on to create 6 separate projects using those very tools and techniques, where we will pull together all of your earlier learning, and give you the confidence to program your own solutions as soon as you finish the course!

What other students are saying:
- "I'm coming close to finishing this course...This course has given me the knowledge and confidence to succeed, get promoted and think seriously about building a career based on what I can learn from great teachers like Alan." - Thomas Heaton
- "Alan is an excellent tutor, goes very deep into every single thing, and he is not bothered to repeat even the smallest tricks and tips along the way. I feel like I got amazing new skill, this course has opened my eyes on how I should "see" excel from now on. Definitely the best course I have ever taken on Udemy" - Aleksandar Stankovic

With So Much Power, What Will You Create?

With the skills you will learn in this course you will be limited only by your imagination.

If you can describe it, you can most likely code it. What will YOU create?

Let's see. Enroll now, and I look forward to welcoming you to the course!
