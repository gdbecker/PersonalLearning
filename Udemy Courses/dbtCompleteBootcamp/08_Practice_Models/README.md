### Models Overview
- Models are the basic building blocks of your business logic
- Materialized as views, tables, etc
- They live in SQL files in the "models" folder
- Models can reference each other and use templates and macros

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Often called "WITH queries," are temporary named result sets used in SQL queries
- They act like subqueries or views within the same query, making complex queries more readable and easier to manage
- CTEs are created using the WITH keyword and can be referenced multiple times within the same query
