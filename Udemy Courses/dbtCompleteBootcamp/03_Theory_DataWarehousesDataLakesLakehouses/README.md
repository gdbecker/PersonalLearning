## 03_ Theory - Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Lakehouses

### Data Warehouses
- Databases that let you do high performance analytics workloads
- Performant engine lets you use SQL
- On-premise warehouses
  - Oracle, IBM, Teradata
  - Tougher to scale
  - Governance and regulatory compliance
- Cloud based
  - Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake
  - Easier to scale
  - Cost efficiency
- You pay for the compute nodes, whether they are used or not

### Data Lakes
- Can handle "external tables" to store data outside of the warehouse
- Can store multiple structured types of data
  - Unstructured, structured, and semi-structured

### Data Lakehouses
- Combines best features of data warehouses and data lakes
- Ensure consistency with ACID transactions
- Handles all types of structured data
