## 01_ Introduction and Outline

### Course Resources
- Github: https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/tree/master/ab_testing

### Bayesian Machine Learning: A/B Testing in Python
- These techniques are used everywhere: marketing, medicine, web development, etc
- Data people need to catch up on these topics if they don't already know about them 

### A Complete Picture
- Start with a review of probability and statistics
- Frequentist statistics and hypothesis testing
- Why? This provides a very nice point of comparison
- Don't try to understand quantum mechanics without Newton!

### Adaptive / Outline Methods
- Appropriate for today's technology platforms
- Very different from inviting 10 people to your office to fill out a survey!
- Culminates in the Bayesian approach
- Proven by Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and other online advertisers

### What is Git?
- Git allows developers to manage/track changes in their code
- You'll need Git skills in the real world, in places where you need to use a version control system

### What are the exercises?
- Sometimes it'll be obvious, because I'll say "please do this exercise"
- Other times, I'll trust that you watched the lecture and understood it
- Whenever you see code, it's exercise time
- Type 1: Just taught an algorithm, and the next lecture involves an implementation of that algorithm
  - Implement the algorithm yourself before you see my code
  - My code is the solution
- Type 2: Just taught a library or API (TensorFlow, PyTorch, statsmodels, scikit-learn, etc)
  - For APIs, you of course won't know the syntax before I show it to you
  - Watch the code lecture, and then re-implement everything on a dataset you care about
  - Use UCI Machine Learning Repository for datasets

### Guidelines for Success
- Use the Q&A
- Meet the prerequisites
- Get your hands dirty and work through the exercises
