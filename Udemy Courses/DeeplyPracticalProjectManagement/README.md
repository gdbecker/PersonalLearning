#### Description

Based on 30 years of PM experience managing projects up to $55M, and working on PM teams on projects up to $3B, this course is your practical companion to the PMI PMBOK, describing how project management is done in real life by the most professional organizations.  At the end of the course, you will not only understand project management, you will be able to implement it as efficiently as we know how.  You will also receive a certificate that gives you the credential Practical Project Manager with the right to append PPM after your name.  Thousands of people are now listing their PPM credential as a career differentiator on their LinkedIN profiles.  It's one thing to be a professional project manager.  It's even better to be able to implement project management in the simplest and most deeply practical way.

First an overview is provided of all the fundamental concepts every Project Manager needs to know.  Then the critically important role of the Project Manager and the keys to team management and leadership are described.  Then the essential PM processes that apply to any project are mapped across the project time-line.  The specific actions you need to take at each step are explained in an easy to follow thread, along with examples.  The use of software tools to support the PM process is explained.  The course provides one complete resource with everything you need to become an expert project manager, and earn your PPM certification.

You will also receive the following resources:
- Professional example.  A complete set of PM documentation for a complex, realistic $44M example project that you can reuse as a model for your own projects.  Includes a Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Requirements Baseline, Work Breakdown Structure, Precedence Diagram, Project Management Plan, Gantt Schedule, Risk Register, and more.
- Templates.  Microsoft Office templates for all the key PM documents, from Stakeholder Register to Project Plan to Final Report.
- MS Office Guide.  An invaluable guide "Project Planning With MS Office" that describes how to use Microsoft Office applications as simply as possible to prepare your project scope, schedule, and budget.
- If you need to manage a project right now, are preparing for a PMI PMP exam, or just want a solid grounding in the PM best practices to enhance your career, this course will really help.  You will also earn 16 Professional Development Units (PDU's).
