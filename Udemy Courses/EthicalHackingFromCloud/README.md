#### Description
Welcome to my comprehensive course that will teach you how to use the cloud for hacking. With NO prior knowledge required, this course takes you from a beginner  to an expert at launching advanced attacks from the cloud. Giving you the ability to hack online accounts, web browsers, bypass two or multi factor authentication, and gain full remote control over all operating systems (Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS) from within the cloud. That's not all, you'll also be able to use the cloud knowledge you acquire in this course to host your own websites and your own cloud applications.

This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory. We'll start with basics of ethical hacking and cloud computing. Then we'll dive and start using the cloud for hacking straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by hacking online accounts, computers, and browsers, no boring dry lectures. By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in cloud computing and ethical hacking.

To achieve this the course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to teach you a specific hacking technique! You'll first learn the cloud concepts related to this technique, then you'll learn how to use the cloud to hack computers, phones, browsers, online accounts and much more. As we do this I will also introduce you to different hacking concepts, tools and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals, there will be no useless or boring lectures!

All the techniques in this course are practical and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack from the cloud. Therefore by the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios .

As mentioned this course will will teach you both ethical hacking and cloud computing at the same time, here are some of the topics that will be covered in the course:
