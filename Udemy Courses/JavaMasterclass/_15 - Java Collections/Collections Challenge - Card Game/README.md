## Collections Challenge: Card Game

In the last video, I introduced you to quite a few methods on the java.util.Collections class, and showed you examples, using a deck of cards.

Now, it's your turn.

Think for a moment about a card game that you'd enjoy building, and one you know some of the rules for.
1. Create a deck of cards, either a standard deck, or a deck that's specialized to the card game you want to create.
2. Shuffle your deck.
3. Deal your players' hands. Pick the number of players playing, and figure out how you'll deal the cards, one at a time to each hand, or some other way.
4. Evaluate your players' hands for card combinations that are important to the game.
5. Use a combination of java.util.Collections and List methods, to achieve your results.
