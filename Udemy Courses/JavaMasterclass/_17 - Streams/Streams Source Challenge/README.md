## Streams Source Challenge

In the last video, I reviewed the following methods to generate a Stream.
In this coding challenge, you'll be using most of these methods to set up a few streams of your own.

Generate the bingo ball labels as 5 different streams, using different Stream creation methods for each.
Assign each pipeline to a stream variable.
Concatenate the five streams together.
Apply the terminal operation, forEach, to the final concatenated stream, to print each label.
These should be printed in order as follows.
 - B1-B15,
 - I16-I30,
 - N31-N45,
 - G45-G60,
 - O61-O75.

Remember that the map intermediate operation, takes a Function, so you can return a different type, than the input stream element.
To do this, you'd use map to return a String, by executing a method or expression that takes an integer, and returns a string.
The generate method may be difficult to use, without creating side effects, or using other intermediate operations I haven't yet mentioned, but if you want a good challenge, you can play around with this one.
Go away and give that a try, and when you're ready, come back, and we can walk through my solution together.
