## Immutable Classes Challenge

In this challenge, you should create a BankAccount class.
This should have a type, indicating the type of account, like Checking or Savings or some other type.
It should have a balance, the initial dollar amount in the account.
You should also create a BankCustomer that has a customer name, a customer id, and a List of accounts.
You should use the techniques I discussed in the last videos, to design these classes.
Create a couple of instances of bank customers, confirming that you can't change a Customer's data at all, after it's initialized.
Create a subclass of the bank customer, and confirm that the subclass can't tamper with the customer's data as well.
