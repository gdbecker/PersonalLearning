### Learning Advice
- To get the most out of the course and ensure you improve your skills, here are some advice for you:
- Take your time. It's not a race. Watch the videos multiple times if needed.
- Don't just watch the video, but do what I show you in the practical videos.
- Ask questions! There are no dumb questions, and I'm here for you.
- If you're stuck, try to find a solution, read your code twice, and then raise your issue on the Q/A.
- Turn on the captions if you feel my French accent sounds too "baguette" for you.
- Enjoy the journey! Learning is great ❤️
