## 03_ Cloud Service Types

### Types
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- "As a service"
  - You can rent it for a short time, if you wish
  - No commitment, if you wish
  - Pay for what you use (time, storage, or other)
  - Cloud provider takes care of buying, developing, and maintaining it
- IaaS
  - Essential services of IT
    - Computing
    - Storage
    - Networking
  - Generally have "real world" equivalents in your own data center
  - Cloud replacements of real world things
- IaaS Computing
  - One example is Azure Virtual Machines (VM)
  - Pay by the seconds
  - Many choices in CPU speeds, RAM, optimizations
- IaaS Storage
  - Azure Storage is an example
  - 5 PB of storage capacity
  - Can handle blobs, files, queues, and tables
  - Can also be configured as a data lake
- IaaS Networking
  - Virtual Networking is an example of this
  - Virtual Networks don't cost anything
  - There are ingress and egress bandwidth costs
- PaaS
  - Cloud service providers have an opportunity to provide more than just the "basic" infrastructure
  - PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage, and networking
  - Middleware, development tools, database server, and more
- PaaS Computing
  - One example is Azure App Services
  - Simply upload your code and configuration to Azure, and it runs your code without needing to worry about the VM underneath
  - Includes scaling features, CI/CD, containers, staging and development environments, etc
- PaaS Storage
  - Managed Storage is an example 
  - Azure SQL Database is another example
  - Freed from worrying about the server VM itself or the hard disk itself
- PaaS Networking
  - Azure Front Door is an example
  - or Load Balancer
  - or Firewall
  - These are software apps that perform networking tasks
- SaaS
  - Full-fledged apps
  - Cloud apps
  - Tools like Office 365, OneDrive, Skype
  - The app is ready to be used and you simply need to set it up and use it

### Serverless
- Some services in Azure have a "serverless" option
- Serverless is effectively a different pricing model
- Paying for service not renting hardware
- Serverless services
  - Functions
  - Container apps
  - Kubernetes
  - SQL databases
  - Cosmos DB
